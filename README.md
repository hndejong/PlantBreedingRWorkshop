# PlantBreedingRWorkshop
### R Workshop for Plant Breeding Applications in Ethiopia

#### Purpose

These materials were developed for an introductory R workshop for plant breeders in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. 

The slides in PlantBreedingRWorkshopSlides.pdf summarize key points, with examples and exercises found in Exercises.R and Exercise_solutions.R.

The workshop is two-part:
1) R and RStudio basics, with examples and exercises
2) R applications for plant breeding, with example code to read in, visualize, and analyze some example data from a potato variety trial

The example data sets were selected to be relevant to the interests of Ethiopian plant breeders. The code was designed to require minimal package downloads in case of unreliable internet connections. 


#### Data set sources

island_areas.csv is a file containing the built-in R data set "islands"

orange_tree_growth.txt is a file containing the built-in R data set "Orange"

Potato.Variety.Trial.Data.txt is fabricated example data based on the types of data often collected for potato variety field trials
